# üî¨ Microbe Explorer: Unraveling Belly Button Biodiversity üå±

Welcome to Microbe Explorer, where we dive into the fascinating world of belly button biodiversity! üß´üîç

**Project Overview:**
In this assignment, we'll construct an interactive dashboard to delve into the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which offers insights into the diverse microbial communities inhabiting human navels.

**Files:**

**index.html:** Your dashboard's homepage, providing an interface for exploration.  
**samples.json:** Contains the dataset of belly button microbial samples.  
**static/:** Directory containing necessary CSS and JavaScript files.  

**Instructions:**
  
Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to showcase the top 10 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) found in each individual.  
Construct a bubble chart displaying each sample's microbial diversity.  
Showcase sample metadata, including demographic information, on the dashboard.  
Ensure all plots dynamically update when a new sample is selected.  
Deploy your dashboard to a free static page hosting service, such as GitHub Pages.  

**Advanced Challenge Assignment (Optional):**

For those seeking an extra challenge, adapt the Gauge Chart to visualize the weekly washing frequency of individuals, updating the chart accordingly when a new sample is selected.

## Visualizations

**Bar Chart:** Initialization, updates, data values, labels, and tooltip   

I have used Github deployment to host index.html. Kindly use following link to open the browser-

**Bubble Chart:** Initialization, updates, axes, colors, size, and labels   
**Metadata and Deployment:** Initialization, updates, and successful deployment   

**Let's Dive In!**  
Uncover the mysteries within the navel and illuminate the wonders of belly button biodiversity. üåü
